# Origins

**Trux** was developed for my task management & analytics SPA, **Tr**akktion and was inspired by [Fl**ux**](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) concepts. After hashing out the main concepts and developing a functional prototype, I felt it was working quite nicely and thought others might find it useful, so I decided to open source it.

Development started a while ago and, at the time, [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) was only just emerging as a possible option for state management amongst others such as [Altjs](http://alt.js.org/) and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) to name a few. Unsure which to go with I had a quick read over the concepts of Flux and decided to roll my own solution. Trux worked well for me, made sense \(at least to me\), was easy to set up and powerful enough to do what I needed so I stuck with it.

Designed for a component driven architecture, Trux was originally developed with React and a REST API in mind. However, it's no longer limited to these, it can easily be used with other libraries or API systems as well.
