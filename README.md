# Trux
## A micro data framework for ReactJS

Trux is a simple yet effective way of managing data for your React app. It comes packed with a parent object `Trux` and two data store objects, `TruxModel` and `TruxCollection` which you are meant to extend for your own use cases.

Trux is all about inheritance, which means any `new TruxModel` or `new TruxCollection` you instantiate will have access to the base methods of those objects, but will also be extendible with custom methods.

Checkout the examples to get an idea of how to use Trux.

Trux was developed for my project management & analytics application, `Trakktion`. After developing Trux, I felt it was working quite nicely for me and thought others might find it useful, so I decided to turn it into its own thing.
