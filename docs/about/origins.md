# Origins

Trux was developed for my task management & analytics SPA, **Tr**akktion and was inspired by [Fl**ux**](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) concepts. After hashing out the main concepts and developing a working prototype, I felt it was working quite nicely for me and thought others might find it useful, so I decided to open source it. Development started a while ago and, at the time, [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) was only just emerging as a possible option for state management and after having a quick read over the concepts of Flux, I decided to just roll my own solution. Trux worked well for me, it made sense \(at least to me\), was easy to set up and powerful enough to do what I needed so I stuck with it. 

Originally developed with React and a REST API in mind, Trux is no longer limited to these, it can easily be used with other libraries or API systems as well. 

Some have pointed out that it reminds them of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), which is interesting because I've actually never used the framework. After looking over their API I do see the similarities, but I guess Trux is far more stripped back and was designed for storing state for a component driven architecture. If I had to choose a source of inspiration, I'd actually have to say [Laravel's](https://laravel.com/) [Eloquent Models](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions) had a pretty big influence on the direction it took.
