### `API ⇆ Trux ➝ UI`

Unidirectional data layer for reactive user interfaces.

## Introduction

Trux is an easy-to-use, lightweight and effective way of managing mutable data for your client side JavaScript app.

With its focus placed on enabling the creation of fully customisable and effective bridges between your data and UI, Trux provides convenient and safe ways to mutate data and synchronise these changes with your components.

**With Trux, your data stores become the sources of truth for your app's data dependent user interfaces.**

Trux doesn't care how you structure your app, all you need to do is create some stores, connect components to them and watch it all work. While it was designed with React and a REST API in mind, it can also be used with Vue and GraphQL \(and probably other frameworks/patterns\) with little to no difference.
