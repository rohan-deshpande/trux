# Origins

**Trux** was developed for my task management & analytics SPA, **Tr**akktion and was inspired by [Fl**ux**](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) concepts. After hashing out the main concepts and developing a working prototype, I felt it was working quite nicely for me and thought others might find it useful, so I decided to open source it. 

Development started a while ago and, at the time, [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) was only just emerging as a possible option for state management and after having a quick read over the concepts of Flux, I decided to just roll my own solution. Trux worked well for me, it made sense \(at least to me\), was easy to set up and powerful enough to do what I needed so I stuck with it.

Designed for a component driven architecture, Trux was originally developed with React and a REST API in mind. However, it's no longer limited to these, it can easily be used with other libraries or API systems as well.
