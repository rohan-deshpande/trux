# Store

The `Store` class is not exported by Trux as it is not designed to be used directly, it is, however, the parent class to both `Trux.Model` and `Trux.Collection` so understanding some of its core properties and methods is essential. Every `Trux.Model` and `Trux.Collection` inherits all of the properties and methods of `Store`.
